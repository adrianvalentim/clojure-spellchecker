# clojure-spellchecker
Unfortunally this is not a software to identify what spell a given wizard is casting. Rather is a simple checker for the spelling of English words. When a word is not found on the big list of words, the program offers a replacement. This was written with the personal intent of later on playing with different features and methods, such as probabilistic analysis or natural language processing, to improve the bare-bonds spell checker here implemented.
